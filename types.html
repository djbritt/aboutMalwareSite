                <h3>Malware</h3>
                <p id="text">Malware is a shortened word for malicious software, which in other words is software that is used to compromise computers, steal data, bypass security, or cause harm to the computer. Malware tends to be a broad term that refers to a few
                    kinds of of malicious programs. This most common types of malware are adware, ransomware, rootkit, virus, bot, bug, worm and trojan horse.

                <h3>Adware</h3>
                <p id="text">Adware (advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that forcefully delivers advertisements. A few examples of adware include pop-ups on websites and advertisements that are displayed by software. More often than not, software
                    and applications offer “free” versions that come bundled with adware. Most adware is sponsored or authored by advertisers brings in money. While some adware is only designed to deliver advertisements, it is not uncommon for adware
                    to come bundled with spyware that is capable of tracking user activity and stealing information. Due to the added capabilities of spyware, adware/spyware bundles are significantly more dangerous than adware on its own.</p>

                <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                <p id="text">Ransomware is a type of malware that basically holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. This malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking the system and displaying
                    messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer.

                <h3>Rootkit</h3>
                <p id="text">A rootkit is a type of malicious software created to remotely access or control a computer without being triggering a security program or the user’s attention. When a rootkit has been installed, a malicious party behind the rootkit can
                    remotely execute files, access or steal information, modify system configurations, install hidden malware, or use the computer as part of a botnet. Rootkit prevention, detection, and removal can be difficult due to their sneaky style.
                    Because a rootkit always hides its presence, typical security products are not effective in detecting and removing rootkits. As a result, rootkit detection relies on manual methods such as monitoring computer behavior for irregular
                    activity.

                <h3>Virus</h3>
                <p id="text">A virus is a form of malware that has the effect similar to a cold, it can infect others around itself. Viruses attach themselves to programs and execute code when a user launches one of those infected programs. Viruses can also spread
                    through scripts, documents, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps. Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more.

                <p id="text">Bots are software programs which are programmed to perform certain tasks. While some bots are created for fun purposes (video gaming, internet auctions, online contests, etc), bots are found to be used maliciously. They can be used in
                    botnets (collections of computers to be controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, or as spam creators, or as a scraper of server data.

                <h3>Bug</h3>
                <p id="text">In software, a bug is an error that produces issues. These issues are usually the result of human error and usually exist in the source code or compilers of a program. Small bugs only slightly affect a program’s behavior and as a result
                    can be hidden for a long time before being found and removed. Larger bugs can cause crashing or freezing of programs. Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs and can allow attackers to bypass user authentication, override access
                    privileges, or steal data.

                <h3>Worm</h3>
                <p id="text">A computer worm is a very common type of malware. It spreads over computer networks through operating system vulnerabilities. Worms cause harm to their host networks by using up bandwidth and overloading web servers. A worm can also spread
                    payloads, which are commonly designed to steal data, delete files, or create botnets. Computer worms can be classified as a type of computer virus, but here are the differences. One difference is that computer worms can self-replicate
                    and spread by itself while viruses need human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with compromised attachments to users’ contacts.

                <h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
                <p id="text">A Trojan horse, otherwise known as a “Trojan,” is a type of malware that hides itself as a healthy file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious user external access to an infected
                    computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, the attacker can then steal data (logins, financial data, even electronic money), install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging,
                    etc), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker.
