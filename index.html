                <p id="text">Malware, it’s all around you, ready to take your information when you are least expecting it. Have you ever gotten malware, ever seen it’s effects of what it can do to your computer, or electronics in general? Malware has an interesting
                    history, with the first piece of malware, according to Lavasoft, was created in 1971, and was coined Creeper <a href="sources.html">(News, 2013)</a>. This piece of malware infected what was known as the ARPAnet, which was a foundation of the internet.
                    There isn’t much other information on what the virus did, besides infecting a computer, and displaying “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!” Malware has since then left the age of a teenager writing a program to infect a computer,
                    and now is usually written by a professional programmer for a specific reason. PC Tools states that, “Malware is an abbreviated term meaning “malicious software.” This is software that is specifically designed to gain access or damage
                    a computer without the knowledge of the owner <a href="sources.html">(PC Tools, 2012)</a>.”</p>

                <h2>My Definition</h2>
                <br>
                <p id="text">As a computer science minor, I have actually had experience working with computers for quite some time. My father taught me some basic computer repair skills as I was growing up, and eventually he allowed me to take the home jobs that
                    he was getting. The conventional way of thinking about malware is described by Avast Antivirus. They state, “Types of malware include spyware, adware, phishing, viruses, trojan horses, worms, rootkits, ransomware and browser hijackers <a href="sources.html">(Avast
                    2016)</a>.” In my experience of running a computer repair business, I don’t find this explanation of malware to fit very well. When somebody calls me over because every time they try to go to a website, it takes them to another website,
                    or if their computer randomly opens up popups every 5 seconds, I run a tool to help fix the issue. This tool, which I will discuss along with others in the third module, takes care of these issues. But most all of these bugs that I
                    remove from these computers, were on people’s computers because of things they did through the internet. And most all of these issues were just on the people’s browsers, not completely infecting people’s computers, and stealing data,
                    such as a virus or a keylogger would do.

                <br>
                <p id="text">As you continue to explore this website, there will be a few pages of information that may be helpful to you. The next page will be discussing the different kinds of popular malware (as the industry states malware to be), and a short definition
                    of these types of malware. The next page, or as the class this is for calls it, a module, will contain a quiz that is hand coded by myself about malware and it’s effects on computers. The second module will be small examples I will
                    make that will show how malware can act. And lastly the third module will be a video explaining some malware prevention tools in use, and links below the video on where to download them.
