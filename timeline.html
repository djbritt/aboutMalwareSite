                    <p>This is known to computer enthusiasts as the first computer virus. Although the internet was not as popular today as it was in 1971, there was still a network called ARPANET, that was the beginning of today’s internet. There isn’t much other information on what the virus did, besides infecting a computer, and displaying “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!”

It infected Apple DOS 3.3 operating systems and spread through floppy disks. The computers that were infected displayed a poem on every 50th boot which said “Elk Cloner: The program with a personality It will get on all your disks It will infiltrate your chips Yes, it's Cloner! It will stick to you like glue It will modify RAM too Send in the Cloner!”
