# What is Malware? :computer:

Have you every wanted a safe, interactive, and fun way to learn about malware? Well this hand coded website can let you do that.

This was a website, my final project, I made by myself (even though it was a group project, I tested out of the class, and was only required to do the final project), for a class called Computing for Digital Artists.

The description was

> The group project is designed to give you and your group members the opportunity to do an in-depth
exploration of a computing topic of interest beyond what we are able to cover in class. You will be able
to choose the topic, with the caveat that no topics can be repeated and all topics are subject to my
approval. The project is also designed to showcase your creative and artistic talents while also learning
course material. The project will result in an interactive learning module that is targeted to other digital
artists interested in learning about your topic.

This website uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.
